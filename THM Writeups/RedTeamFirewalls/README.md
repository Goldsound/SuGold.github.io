### Task 3 Evasion via Controlling the Source MAC/IP/Port

> What is the size of the IP packet when using a default Nmap stealth (SYN) scan?
Add the size of the TCP header and the IP header to find the total size of the packet. 

`24` + `20` = `44`

> How many bytes does the TCP segment hold in its data field when using a default Nmap stealth (SYN) scan?

A default SYN scan holds `0` bytes in its data field.

> Approximately, how many packets do you expect Nmap to send when running the command ```nmap -sS -F MACHINE_IP```? Approximate to the nearest 100, such as 100, 200, 300, etc.

The answer is `200` packets. -F Scans the top 100 ports and each port is expected to recieve 2 SYN packets.

> Approximately, how many packets do you expect Nmap to send when running the command nmap -sS -Pn -D RND,10.10.55.33,ME,RND -F MACHINE_IP? Approximate to the nearest 100, such as 100, 200, 300, etc.

2 packets per port * 100 ports * 4 IPs = `800`

> What do you expect the target to see as the source of the scan when you run the command nmap -sS -Pn --proxies 10.10.13.37 MACHINE_IP

`10.10.13.37`

> What company has registered the following Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), i.e., the first 24 bits of a MAC address, 00:02:DC?

Lookup `00:02:DC` on https://macaddress.io/ the answer is `Fujitsu General Ltd`

> To mislead the opponent, you decided to make your port scans appear as if coming from a local access point that has the IP address 10.10.0.254. What option needs to be added to your Nmap command to spoof your address accordingly?

`-S 10.10.0.254`

> You decide to use Nmap to scan for open UDP ports. You notice that using nmap -sU -F MACHINE_IP to discover the open common UDP ports wonâ€™t give you any meaningful results. What do you need to add to your Nmap command to set the source port number to 53?

`-g 53`

### Task 4 Evasion via Forcing Fragmentation, MTU, and Data Length

> What is the size of the IP packet when running Nmap with the -f option?

`8` (fragmented TCP header) + `20` (size of data fragment) = `28`

> What is the maximum size of the IP packet when running Nmap with the -ff option?

`16` (fragmented TCP header) + `20` (size of data fragment) = `36`

> What is the maximum size of the IP packet when running Nmap with --mtu 36 option?

`36` (fragmented TCP header) + `20` (size of data fragment) = `56`
 
> What is the maximum size of the IP packet when running Nmap with --data-length 128 option?

`128` (fragmented TCP header) + `20` (size of data fragment) = `148`

### Task 5 Evasion via Modifying Header Fields

> Scan the attached MS Windows machine using --ttl 2 option. How many ports appear to be open?

`3`

> Scan the attached MS Windows machine using the --badsum option. How many ports appear to be open?

`0`

> Using this simple technique, discover which port number is reachable from the protected system.

`nc -lvnp 1025` on Attacker Machine, `nc AttkIP 21` Answer is `21`
